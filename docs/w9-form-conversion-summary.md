## Compliance Notes

- **Data Security**: SSN/TIN masked visually, stored securely in Firebase with proper authentication rules
- **Retention**: Documents stored in Firebase Storage for tax record keeping

## Firebase Security Rules (Required)

Ensure your Firestore rules restrict document access:

```javascript
match /w9_forms/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```
