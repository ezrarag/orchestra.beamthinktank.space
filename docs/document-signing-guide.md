# Document Signing Feature Guide

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive document signing system that allows musicians to fill out and sign important documents (W-4 forms, Performance Contracts, Media Release forms) directly within the platform. Completed documents are automatically stored in Firebase and emailed to designated recipients (Dayvin and Ethan).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Document Signing Component (`DocumentSigner.tsx`)
- Interactive form for W-4 Employee Withholding Certificate
- Fields include:
  - Personal information (name, address, city, state, ZIP)
  - Tax information (SSN, filing status, allowances, withholding)
  - Digital signature field
  - Date field
- Generates HTML-based document (ready for PDF conversion)
- Can be extended for other document types (Performance Contract, Media Release)

### 2. Email Notification System (`/api/documents/notify`)
- Automatically sends formatted emails to:
  - **dayvin.hauga@gmail.com**
  - **ethan@beamthinktank.space**
- Includes:
  - Document type
  - Musician name and email
  - Submission date
  - Direct link to view document
- Uses nodemailer for SMTP email delivery

### 3. Firebase Integration
- Documents are stored in Firebase Storage
- Metadata saved to Firestore for tracking
- Documents automatically archived with timestamp and musician information

### 4. Donations Data Connection
- Donations now fetch from Firebase Firestore
- Falls back to mock data if no donations found
- Includes loading states and error handling
- Filters donations by recipient name

### 5. Updated UI
- "Fill Out & Sign" buttons instead of generic upload buttons
- Loading states for donations
- Empty states when no data available
- Integrated document signer modal

## How It Works

### For Musicians:

1. **Access Documents**: Navigate to Profile → Documents tab
2. **Choose Document**: Click "Fill Out & Sign" for W-4, Performance Contract, or Media Release
3. **Complete Form**: Fill out all required fields in the modal
4. **Sign**: Type your name as a digital signature
5. **Submit**: Document is automatically:
   - Generated as PDF
   - Saved to Firebase Storage
   - Emailed to Dayvin and Ethan
   - Tracked in Firestore database

### For Admin (Dayvin/Ethan):

1. **Receive Email**: Get notification when a musician submits a document
2. **View Document**: Click the link in the email to download/view the PDF
3. **Access Files**: All documents are stored in Firebase Storage for easy access

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Email Configuration

Update your `.env.local` file with SMTP credentials:

```env
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@beamthinktank.space
```

**For Gmail:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password: Google Account → Security → App Passwords
3. Use that password in SMTP_PASSWORD

### 2. Firebase Setup

The document signing requires Firebase Storage. Ensure:
- Firebase Storage is enabled in Firebase Console
- Storage rules allow uploads from authenticated users
- Firestore is set up with proper security rules

### 3. Firestore Structure

The system expects these collections:

**donations** collection:
```typescript
{
  donor_name: string
  amount: number
  message?: string
  created_at: Timestamp
  recipientName: string // musician's name
}
```

**documents** collection (auto-created):
```typescript
{
  musicianEmail: string
  musicianName: string
  documentType: 'w4' | 'contract' | 'mediaRelease'
  downloadUrl: string
  submittedAt: Timestamp
}
```

## Extension for Other Documents

To add more document types (Performance Contract, Media Release):

1. Update `DocumentSigner.tsx` to include custom fields for the document type
2. Add conditional rendering based on `documentType` prop
3. Update the HTML generation function to match the document format
4. The email notification and storage already handle all document types

## Storage Locations

- **Documents**: Firebase Storage → `documents/{documentType}/{musicianName}_{timestamp}.pdf`
- **Metadata**: Firestore → `documents` collection
- **Donations**: Firestore → `donations` collection

## Email Template

The email sent to Dayvin and Ethan includes:
- Clean, professional design with gradient header
- Document type and musician information
- Direct download link
- Submission timestamp
- Responsive layout

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **PDF Generation**: Use pdf-lib or jsPDF for actual PDF creation instead of HTML
2. **Digital Signature**: Add canvas-based signature drawing
3. **Document Templates**: Load W-4 and other forms as PDF templates
4. **Multi-step Forms**: Break long forms into multiple steps
5. **Document Status**: Track "submitted", "reviewed", "approved" states
6. **Notifications**: Add in-app notifications for document status updates

## Testing

1. Sign in as a musician (with Firebase Auth enabled)
2. Navigate to Documents tab
3. Click "Fill Out & Sign" on W-4 Form
4. Complete all fields
5. Submit the form
6. Check email for Dayvin and Ethan
7. Verify document appears in Firebase Storage
8. Confirm metadata saved in Firestore

## Troubleshooting

### Email not sending?
- Check SMTP credentials in `.env.local`
- Verify SMTP_PASSWORD is an app-specific password (not regular password)
- Check spam folder
- Review server logs for SMTP errors

### Documents not saving?
- Ensure Firebase Storage is enabled
- Check Storage security rules allow writes
- Verify Firebase credentials are correct

### Donations showing mock data?
- Verify Firestore `donations` collection exists
- Check that `recipientName` field matches musician's name
- Review Firestore security rules

## Code Locations

- **Document Signing Component**: `components/DocumentSigner.tsx`
- **Email API**: `app/api/documents/notify/route.ts`
- **Musician Profile Modal**: `components/MusicianProfileModal.tsx`
- **Environment Config**: `.env.local` (create from `env.example`)
